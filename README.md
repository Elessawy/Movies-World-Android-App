# MoviesWorld
An android application developed for learning proposes for the final project in "Developing Android Apps" course by (Udacity and Google).
It shows the most popular and the most rated movies using an API and allows the user to add movies to favorites and open them again without internet connection.

It uses:
1- Database and Content Providers: to save movies in the favorites and open them again without internet connection
2- Fragments: to make different layouts for large screens (tablets) to make use of the large space efficiently.
3- AsyncTask: to fetch the needed data (movies details) from the API.
4- JSON: evaluating the result data and put them in the right variables.
5- Shared Action Providers: to allow the user to share the first trailer on different applications (as Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp,...).
6- GridView and Adapters: to show the posters of the movies in the main fragment.
